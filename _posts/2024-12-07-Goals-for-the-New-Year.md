title: Goals for 2025
---

It's been a while. 

I've been busy, I started a new job, at EA in vancouver. Working on one of the Sims teams. I also re-signed my mortgage, the rates are crazy high right now, but what can you do. 

Now that most of my life has settled down to a normal level, I'm trying to work on more things and settle in to a more productive routine. 

Recently, while chatting with someone on a dating app, they asked me what are my goals for my life. So that got me thinking about what are some goals I have. Now, I'm not really someone to have super long term goals, but I do think its helpful to set some goals for the short term, maybe next year... and next couple of years. 

So, Here's what I'm thinking of goals are for the next year!

## 1 year goals

### write more blog posts
... no explaination necessary

### learn more about finiancial markets
I've always been pretty good at picking what company to buy, but really bad at figuring out when to sell them. At least that's what I think anyways. So this year, I'm thinking I should learn more about about how the market works, including how to value companies, how to buy/trade options. In general, just to follow the markets movements more and stay up to date with the news. I'm hoping being more up to date with the finiancial market would also help me save a bit more money, instead of just leaving it for 6 months at a time, and spending my money buying random things. 

### Spend regular time to write the app
I'm writing a small iphone app, I'm hoping to spend regular time everyday/week to work on it, and hopefully release it next year. Whether it makes money or not is not really a big dea IMO. But I currently think its a good idea, and people will find it useful. 



I was hoping to have a section for longer time goals, but I can't really think of anything at the moment that I would like to accomplish, except the things of the leve that I joke around of like "become a accomplished engineer at amazon cuz the title is cool".

Anyhow,
