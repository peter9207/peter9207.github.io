title: Iterating ideas
---

Arguably the actual first regular post of the blog, and I have a couple of ideas. 

Since when I write these, I'm probably gonna be in a coffee shop or something or another, I thought maybe I'll always start these off with the weather, the environment I'm in, and then go on to somethings that I actually want to write. I usually don't write a ton of stuff anyways, so this should also serve to inflate the length of the post a little bit, which is good. 

Today, I'm sitting in a cafe called Bump N Grind, on commercial ave. It's a small cafe with 7 tables, with a friendly guy working as the barista behind the bar. The walls are cocvered with for sale paintings from "Vanessa", and half the cafe serving as a thrift store. Most of the thrifting items are old mugs, kitchenware and two racks of womens cloths. It's raining outside, theres a wind warning today, you can see the rain getting blown sideways looking out the window. 

There was a big stock rally in the past week, so my plan today is to review whether the stocks I'm buying are actually still worth it, and if its a good idea to divest some of the positions and buy something a bit more... stable. 

Also, in this past week I changed the frontend app to be a separate repo on its own, and using a more feature full bootstrap repo from ignite, hoping to save on some design work. But I also have the idea of changing the structure of the app a little bit. I'm thinking to have a the main data object be some definition of a "event" and we can create collections of events, and that maybe trips, or whatever else. This will solve two problems, one is that it makes the app a bit more useful for everyday things, instead of just when you go on a trip. Another is that it I was always iffy about how to figure out a trip is a trip, and something is not a trip. This design affectively makes the user deal with it, almost like adding songs to a playlist. 

I want to start on the email parser next week, we can start it off being very naive, and update it later. I feel like a simple parser might not be a bad idea, in this world of AI. We can open source it, and let people have a bit more confidence that their data is not taken for other things. 

Also adding to the structure of maybe these(hopefully) weekly blogs, I want to set a todo list and see how much I complete since the last blog. 

### Todo for next week
 - [ ] get started on the email repo
 - [ ] see what I can learn about email parsers
 - [ ] talk to penny about design
