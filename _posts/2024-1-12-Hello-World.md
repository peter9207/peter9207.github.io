I made a website! 

I had one a long time ago, but it was rather basic and it was hosted on a paid host, that I stopped paying long time ago. Since then I've played with various website makers like Squarespace or Wix, But never wanted to pay for it as I don't get that much use out of it. This time around I noticed github pages supports Jeykll, and thought I'd try it out. 

This is basically made with https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now, which does all the boostrap for you. 

Next my plans is to put more of my thoughts on this blog, and change the layout of this page more to my liking, but for a weekend project, this is great!
