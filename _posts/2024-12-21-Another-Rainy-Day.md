title: Another rainy day
---

It's been raining more or less in Vancouver for the past week or so, we had some atomspheric weather situations and crazy winds. Golf courses actually closed for a couple of days, but it didn't affect where I'm at very much. 

Today we are at a Cafe Algan on South Cambie street. It's a Korean style cafe with a few seats. The cake looks very good, but I ordered a pour over coffee, and a sio bread. It's kind of like a butter bread. The cafe is decorated with 7-8 small white round tables, with 2 chairs each. The decoration is very modern, and they have a open pastry area with some cookies and croissants. Theres no wifi here, so I'm tethering from my phone as I write this. 

The market is pretty low past couple of days, after the fed annoucement saying they might not drop rates as much as they have been signalling next year. The annoucement came exactly as I expected, but aparently the market was expecting better news. My reaction to that is "wow people are greedy". But my portfolio is doing ok still, and I have a better idea of what kind of portfolio I want now. 

I'm thinking of keeping a Canadian dollar portfolio mostly of bonds, and reliable dividend yielding stocks for rainy days, and put the extra money in a US portfolio. With the more stable, reliable canadian portfolio, I can put more money in more risky US tech sctocks that I know a bit more about. 

On the app side, I met up with Penny this week, to talk about the app, She says she's on board, and I'm gonna try to recuit hongyi into it as well. that way I can focus on infra work and try speed up the development time. I took a look at email parsers, theres some paid solutions with existing services that are able to parse iteniary emails, but they look quite expensive. It might be a good idea to train our own model or use a existing trained model to parse emails, but the details of that is to be seen. It's interesting work tho, I do want to try the AI route first, and see. 


### Todo for last week
 - [x] get started on the email repo
 - [x] see what I can learn about email parsers
 - [x] talk to penny about design

### Todo for next week
 - [ ] try to use a trained model to parse emails
